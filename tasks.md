## Purpose of the project
This project will provide you a step-by-step guide to create a C# program to perform basic arithmetic i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

## Verify locally
To test this module locally:
* Open up `BasicArithmeticTests.sln` in `Visual Studio 2019`
* In the Test menu dropdown in Visual Studio open Test Explorer
* In Test Explorer click the double right arrow to run all tests.

## Task 1: In the AddTwoNumbers function add firstNumber and secondNumber and assign the value to the result variable.
Make sure to use the + operator to add the two numbers i.e. result = variable1 + variable2;

## Task 2: In the SubtractSecondNumberFromFirstNumber function add firstNumber and secondNumber and assign the value to the result variable.
Make sure to use the - operator to subtract the second number from the first number i.e. result = variable2 - variable1;

## Task 3: In the DivideFirstNumberBySecondNumber function add firstNumber and secondNumber and assign the value to the result variable.
Make sure to use the / operator to divide the first number by the second number i.e. result = variable1 / variable2;

## Task 4: In the MultiplyTwoNumbers function multiply firstNumber and secondNumber and assign the value to the result variable.
Make sure to use the * operator to add the two numbers i.e. result = variable1 * variable2;
