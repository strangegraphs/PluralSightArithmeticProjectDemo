## Purpose of the project
This project will provide you a step-by-step guide to create a C# program to perform basic arithmetic i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

## Verify locally
To test this module locally:
* Open up `BasicArithmeticTests.sln` in `Visual Studio 2019`
* In the Test menu dropdown in Visual Studio open Test Explorer
* In Test Explorer click the double right arrow to run all tests.

## Task 1: Addition
In the `Arithmetic.cs` file, in the `AddTwoNumbers` function, add `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and assign the value to the `result` variable.
Make sure to use the `+` operator to add the two numbers i.e. `result = variable1 + variable2;`

## Task 2: Subtraction
In the `Arithmetic.cs` file, in the `SubtractSecondNumberFromFirstNumber` function, subtract `secondNumber` from `firstNumber` and assign the value to the `result` variable.
Make sure to use the `-` operator to subtract the second number from the first number i.e. `result = variable2 - variable1;`

## Task 3: Division
In the `Arithmetic.cs` file, in the `DivideFirstNumberBySecondNumber` function, divide `firstNumber` by `secondNumber` and assign the value to the `result` variable.
Make sure to use the `/` operator to divide the first number by the second number i.e. `result = variable1 / variable2;`

## Task 4: Multiplication
In the `Arithmetic.cs` file, in the `MultiplyTwoNumbers` function, multiply `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and assign the value to the `result` variable.
Make sure to use the `*` operator to add the two numbers i.e. `result = variable1 * variable2;`
